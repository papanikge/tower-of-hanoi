==============

Simple functions on the Tower of Hanoi problem.  
No AI to solve a disc-peg configuration. That's up to you.

##Usage

* Open sbcl (I don't know whether this works on other implementations).
* `(load "game.lsp")`
* Use the `init` function to initialize and the `move` function to move discs.
